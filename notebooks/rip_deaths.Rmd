## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read.csv(file = '../data/deaths.csv')

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Remove any duplicates
df <- df %>%
  arrange(id, -id) %>%
  filter(duplicated(id) == FALSE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
